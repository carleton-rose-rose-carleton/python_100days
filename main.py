  I am signing up for Replits 100 days of python challenge!
  I will make sure to spend my time every day coding along, for a minimum 
  of 10 minutes a day.
  Ill be using replit , an amazing online IDE so i can do this from my 
  phone wherever i happen to be.No excuses for not coding from the middle 
  field!
